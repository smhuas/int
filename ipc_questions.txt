1) Signals 
   process 1 :- use kill(pid,signal_id);
   process 2 :- signalhandler(signal_id);
Short comings:-
   Sending signal between related processes is easy. knowing pid of parent/child process is easy
   sending signal between unrelated processes is difficult. /
   extra code effort to know the pid of the process has to be taken into account.

2)  shared memory 
    process 1 :- create shared memory with key and attach it to the process. write the data to memory.
    process 2 :- get the shared memory access with shared memory key which is already created. /
                 attach the shared memory to the process. read the value from memory.
Short comings:-
    reader process cannot know when the data is available in the shared memory.
    extra signalling mechanism to be implemented to achieve this.

3)  Pipes 
    process 1 :- child process
    process 2 :- parent process
Short comings:-
    1) IPC happens only between related processes

4)  Message Queues
